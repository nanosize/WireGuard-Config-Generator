        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>1. Key Generation</h2>
            <p>We use the open-source <code>libsodium</code> (TweetNaCl) cryptographic library to generate high-security Curve25519 key pairs.</p>
            <p>Both public and private keys are 32 bytes (256 bits) long, ensuring resistance against current cryptographic attacks.</p>
            <p>When a pre-shared key (PSK) is needed, it is generated via the library’s cryptographically secure random number generator (<code>nacl.randomBytes(32)</code>), adding an extra layer of protection.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>2. Generation Location (Server vs. Client)</h2>
            <p>By default, key pairs and PSKs are generated server-side in our Node.js environment (<code>src/configGenerator.js</code>).</p>
            <p>Configuration files (<code>server.conf</code> and <code>peer-*.conf</code>) are assembled in memory, zipped, and delivered over HTTPS.</p>
            <p>QR code rendering happens entirely in your browser; no private key material is ever sent back to our servers after download.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>3. Data Protection &amp; Secure Communication</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTTPS (TLS 1.2+):</strong> All data transfers are encrypted with TLS 1.2 or higher, preventing eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                <li><strong>In-Memory Processing:</strong> Keys and configuration data are held only in memory and discarded immediately after delivery—nothing is written to disk or logs.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure RNG:</strong> All randomness is produced by a CSPRNG built into the cryptographic library, ensuring unpredictability.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>4. Data Retention &amp; Logging</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No private keys, PSKs, or config data are ever persisted to databases or file systems.</li>
                <li>Access and application logs do not record any key material or configuration details.</li>
                <li>We do not collect or store any personal information such as names, email addresses, or IP addresses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>It is your responsibility to securely store downloaded private keys and PSKs. Do not share them with unauthorized parties.</p>
            <p>If you lose a private key, it cannot be recovered—you must generate a new key pair and reconfigure your WireGuard peers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>6. Site Operations &amp; Monitoring</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We use <strong>Google Search Console</strong> to monitor search performance and indexing status.</li>
                <li>All data collected via Google Search Console is anonymized and used solely for site health and improvement metrics.</li>
            </ul>
