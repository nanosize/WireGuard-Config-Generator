        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>1. Key Generation Mechanism</h2>
            <p>We use the TweetNaCl (libsodium) cryptographic library to generate Curve25519 key pairs, ensuring both high performance and strong security.</p>
            <p>The generated public and private keys are 32 bytes (256 bits) long, making them computationally infeasible to break.</p>
            <p>Pre-shared keys (PSKs), when needed, are generated as 32-byte random sequences via a cryptographically secure random number generator (<code>nacl.randomBytes(32)</code>), adding an extra layer of protection.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>2. Generation Location (Server vs. Client)</h2>
            <p>By default, key pairs and PSKs are generated on our server environment (Node.js, in <code>src/configGenerator.js</code>). Once generated, configuration files (<code>server.conf</code> and <code>peer-*.conf</code>) are assembled in memory, zipped, and delivered to you.</p>
            <p>QR code rendering is performed entirely in your browser. Your keys are never sent back to our servers after the initial download.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>3. Data Protection and Security</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encrypted Communication:</strong> All data transfers occur over HTTPS (TLS), preventing eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
                <li><strong>In-Memory Handling:</strong> Keys are held only in server memory and are discarded immediately after ZIP delivery. No keys or configurations are written to disk or logs.</li>
                <li><strong>CSPRNG Usage:</strong> All random values are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>4. Data Retention and Logging</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No private keys, PSKs, or configuration data are persisted in databases or file systems.</li>
                <li>Access and application logs do not record any key material or configuration details.</li>
                <li>We do not collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or IP addresses.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mt-4">
            <h2>5. User Responsibility</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for securely storing your downloaded private keys and PSKs. Do not share them with unauthorized parties.</p>
            <p>If you lose your private key, you must generate a new key pair and reconfigure your WireGuard peers, as lost keys cannot be recovered.</p>
